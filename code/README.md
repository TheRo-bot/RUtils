# RUtils

Ramar's Utility package for Java

Contains a few fun things that I like to use throughout my other projects.
Eventually, I'll chuck this up on maven and make it a RamaRepo. but for now, you've gotta manually compile my stuff.

# How to manually compile my stuff

Download all my projects into one folder and copy this structure:

`/dev/ramar/utils/...`

`/dev/ramar/<projects>/...`

`/bin/`


in `/`, run: `javac -d ./bin/ /dev/ramar/<project>/Main.java`

run by entering `/bin/` and run: `java dev.ramar.<project>.Main`
